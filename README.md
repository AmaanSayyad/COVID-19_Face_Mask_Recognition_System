### ~ A Fully Fledged, Automated Recognition and Detection System.
----

- <p align="justify">Face masks are crucial in minimizing the propagation of Covid-19 and are highly recommended or even obligatory in many situations. 

- <p align="justify">The Proposed System can be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This model can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.

- <p align="justify">The technology assures reliable and real-time (Video Stream) & face detection of public/private users wearing masks. Besides, the system is easy to deploy into any existing system of a business while keeping the safety and privacy of users’ data. Thus Ensuring Human Safety &amp; Human Life is the ultimate aim.

#### Implemented Features Overview:

- [x] Detects Facial expression change.
- [x] Understands Pose change.
- [x] Scaling factor (i.e. size of the image)
- [x] Presence and absence of spectacles, beard, mustache etc.
- [x] Occlusion due to scarf, mask or obstacles in front.
- [x] The shape and color of a mask.
- [x] Overcomes “failure to enroll or template” (FTE).
- [x] The Model provides accurate in-percentage accuracy.
